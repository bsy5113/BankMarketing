# Introduction
### Term deposit is a risk-free financial instrument and a sort of alternative to saving and money market accounts because it gives a higher interest rate with multiple range of durations such as 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 1-year etc. Also, it has less restrictive feature or penalty if the term of the loan is violated in case of early withdrawal. Therefore, people can earn some extra money if they plan their spending in accordance with deposit term. Many people, however, do not know the benefits of the term deposit. As a result, the bank proactively markets to customers so that they can apply for the term deposit. However, the bank needs to know the people who would be interested in undertaking this financial instrument so that their marketing effort is better utilized. Data science can provide the tools and skills to classify people as to who would be more likely to opt for the term deposit. A Portuguese bank undertook such a direct marketing campaign and collected data of people who applied or did not apply for term deposit, and some features related to people to whom they made the call. In this study, the goal is to predict the people who are likely to be opt for the term deposit based on the available profile of data.
